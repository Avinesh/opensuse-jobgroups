# Repository for openqa.opensuse.org job groups

##### In order to add a job group in the repository, you need to add the job group yaml schedule in Jobgroups/ directory and the parameters (GROUPID and YAML_FILE_NAME) in scripts/define_job_group bash script

###### Future additions: job group file matched to job group id using a yaml file
